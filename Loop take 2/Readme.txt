Out of the Loop is a fun phone game for 3 or more players in which players must figure out who is "out of the loop", or doesn't know what the answer is by asking each other questions. The person who is out of the loop is trying to figure out what the answer is. 

To run the program, open up a bash shell within the file directory and type "node server.js". You can then access the game by typing localhost:3000 in your web browsers search bar. 

Furthermore, you can broadcast the game to another device, assuming they are on the same network, by typing in <ipv4>:3000 in the web browser of the alternate device where ipv4 is the ipv4 address of the device which is running the server.
